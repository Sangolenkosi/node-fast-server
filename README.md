## Features

- **Fast Setup**: Get started with a pre-configured environment.
- **Modular Routing**: Organize your routes efficiently.
- **Environment Variables**: Manage configuration easily with dotenv.
- **CORS Support**: Handle cross-origin requests seamlessly.
- **MVC Architecture**: Follow best practices with the Model-View-Controller pattern.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Use Mongoose for database operations.

## Installation

To install the Node Fast Server, clone the repository and run the setup command. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sangolenkosi/node-fast-server.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd node-fast-server
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the setup command:
   ```bash
   npm run setup
   ```

## Usage

Once you have installed the server, you can start it by running:

```bash
npm start
```

Your server will run on `http://localhost:3000`. You can access it through your browser or use tools like Postman to test the API endpoints.

## Folder Structure

Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the folder structure:

```
node-fast-server/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ controllers/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ middlewares/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ routes/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ .env
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

- **controllers/**: Contains the logic for handling requests.
- **middlewares/**: Holds middleware functions for request processing.
- **models/**: Defines the data models using Mongoose.
- **routes/**: Contains route definitions.
- **config/**: Manages configuration settings.

## Configuration

You can manage your environment variables using the `.env` file. Hereâ€™s an example of what it might look like:

```
PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase
```

Make sure to adjust the `MONGODB_URI` to match your database connection.

## Routing

The server uses Express for routing. You can define your routes in the `src/routes` directory. Hereâ€™s an example of a simple route:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const { getItems } = require('../controllers/itemController');

router.get('/items', getItems);

module.exports = router;
```

## Middleware

Middleware functions are essential for handling requests. You can create custom middleware in the `src/middlewares` directory. Hereâ€™s an example of a simple logging middleware:

```javascript
const logger = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  next();
};

module.exports = logger;
```

## Database Integration

This template integrates with MongoDB using Mongoose. To define a model, create a new file in the `src/models` directory. Hereâ€™s an example:

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const itemSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: { type: String, required: true },
  price: { type: Number, required: true },
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('Item', itemSchema);
```

## Testing

You can write tests for your application using a testing framework like Jest or Mocha. Create a `tests` directory to organize your test files. Hereâ€™s an example of a simple test:

```javascript
const request = require('supertest');
const app = require('../src/app');

describe('GET /items', () => {
  it('should return a list of items', async () => {
    const res = await request(app).get('/items');
    expect(res.statusCode).toEqual(200);
    expect(res.body).toHaveProperty('items');
  });
});
```
